Cel is not in control, it is driven by the host program.  This is the prime directive.\r\n2. Cel will not impose dependencies.\r\n3. Cel will enable, but not enforce sandboxing.  The host process must do \r\nsome work to realize this, otherwise requirements 1 and 2 would be broken. \r\nThis requirement was inspired by how World of Warcraft allowed user defined\r\nplugins to manipulate the gui.\r\n4. Cel will not define how or when rendering occurs, see requirements 1 and 2.\r\n5. Cel shall not impose or require fragile rules.  For example unlinking a\r\ncel will always work.  Seems obvious, but many gui libraries do not work\r\nlike this.\r\n6. All cels are created equal.  Meaning all cels follow the same rules, so \r\nthere is not a special cel that is a container, all cels are containers.  A\r\nspecialized cel can add functionality, but not alter the basics.  This goes\r\na long way towards meeting requirent 5.\r\n7. A cel will not expose functions or state that will compromise any of the\r\nrequirements.  This is requriement is to realize requirement 5.  The most \r\napparent consequnce of this requirement is that there is no way to get to a\r\ncel you don't already have a reference to, unless it is explicitly provied \r\nfor by a container, or the host process. For instance there is no \r\ncel.gethost() function, this is to enforce both sandboxing and \r\n     non-fragility.  For example a composite cel may depend on the presence\r\n    of the cels it is composed of.  To ensure this a composite cel will\r\n    not expose the individual cels and never need worry about the state of\r\n    those cels being modified externally.\r\nWhat this means in practice is that I can create cels and compose them and\r\ngive access to only the host cel.  The host process may provide a way to \r\nquery a cel by name or some other method, but the interals of that host cel\r\nknown only to the host cel.  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"documentation/cel/cel.html\">cel</a>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
