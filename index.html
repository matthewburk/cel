<p>Cel was designed to meet these requirements, in order of importance:
1. Cel is not in control, it is driven by the host program.  This is the prime directive.
2. Cel will not impose dependencies.
3. Cel will enable, but not enforce sandboxing.  The host process must do 
some work to realize this, otherwise requirements 1 and 2 would be broken. 
This requirement was inspired by how World of Warcraft allowed user defined
plugins to manipulate the gui.
4. Cel will not define how or when rendering occurs, see requirements 1 and 2.
5. Cel shall not impose or require fragile rules.  For example unlinking a
cel will always work.  Seems obvious, but many gui libraries do not work
like this.
6. All cels are created equal.  Meaning all cels follow the same rules, so 
there is not a special cel that is a container, all cels are containers.  A
specialized cel can add functionality, but not alter the basics.  This goes
a long way towards meeting requirent 5.
7. A cel will not expose functions or state that will compromise any of the
requirements.  This is requriement is to realize requirement 5.  The most 
apparent consequnce of this requirement is that there is no way to get to a
cel you don't already have a reference to, unless it is explicitly provied 
for by a container, or the host process. For instance there is no 
cel.gethost() function, this is to enforce both sandboxing and 
     non-fragility.  For example a composite cel may depend on the presence
    of the cels it is composed of.  To ensure this a composite cel will
    not expose the individual cels and never need worry about the state of
    those cels being modified externally.
What this means in practice is that I can create cels and compose them and
give access to only the host cel.  The host process may provide a way to 
query a cel by name or some other method, but the interals of that host cel
known only to the host cel.  </p>
