<h1>1 - Introduction</h1>

<p>Cel is a pure Lua library.  It is desigend to be embedded into a host application.
The host application must provide Cel with input from the user and access to
system resources, and also provide rendering for Cel.
 
<p> Before Cel is usable we need to install a driver for it, the driver is responsible
for provding device input, fonts, clipboard access and other miscellaneous functions 
that are platform specific.  This section is meant to serve as an example on how to
create the driver and use it to drive Cel.

<h1>The driver module</h1>
<p>We will create a module for our driver, that will allow any love application to
use Cel by requiring this module. See <a>not yet defined source listing</a> for the 
comlete source for this module.

<p>To embed Cel. First require the cel module.
<div><pre><code>
local cel = require 'cel' 
</code></pre></div>

<p>We add new table in the global love table, to allow the love application to interface
with the Cel driver. (We will use the love.cel table later to define cels that are
dependent on the love platform.)  We are also making love.cel a proxy for cel.

<div><pre><code>
love.cel = setmetatable({}, {__index = cel})
</code></pre></div> 

<p>Before we install the driver Cel requires a table that maps the platform key codes and states
to the names that Cel will use (for the mouse and keyboard).  
This mapping has a big advantage, all events from Cel will use the plaform codes.  What that means
is that this the application developer can use the love codes for callbacks like this:
<div><pre><code>
  local example = cel.new(100, 100) --create a cel with specified width and height
  
  function example:onkeydown(key)
    if key == 'escape' then
      love.event.push('q') -- quit the game
    end 
  end
</code></pre></div> 

<p>Using the platforms keycodes is great unless you write a new cel that you want to use on 
multiple platforms, in that case you would use the cel to access the keycodes by name, like this:
<div><pre><code>
  local example = cel.new(100, 100) --create a cel with specified width and height
  
  function example:onkeydown(key)
    if key == cel.keyboard.keys.escape then
      --do something that is platform agnostic
    end 
  end
</code></pre></div> 

<p>Cel will acess the buttons table with keys 'left', 'right', 'middle', to get the code for 
mouse buttons. Love uses the 'l', 'r', 'm' as the codes for left, right, and middle mouse buttons.

<div><pre><code>
local mouse = {
  buttons = {
    left = 'l',
    right = 'r',
    middle = 'm',
  },

  --love has no codes for the mouse state, so we will use the names cel uses.
  states = {
    unknown = 'unknown',
    normal = 'normal',
    pressed = 'pressed',
  },

  wheeldirection = {
    up = 'wu',
    down = 'wd',
  },
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>As of now Cel uses the exact key codes that love uses becuause it is
fairly complete and there is no universal standard.  The keyboard should
define this mapping in the keys table.

<div><pre><code>
local keyboard = {
  --we don't actually have to define this for love, since they are the same
  --the keys will match the values
  keys = setmetatable({}, {__index = function(t, k, v) return k end}),

  --love has no codes for the key states, so we will use the names cel uses.
  --The 'repeat' state indicates the key is being held down
  states = {
    unknown = 'unknown',
    normal = 'normal',
    pressed = 'pressed',
    ['repeat'] = 'repeat',
  }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>With the mouse and keyboard mappings defined we can install the driver.  A proxytable is 
returned which will be a bidirectional interface. 
<div><pre><code>
local driver = cel.installdriver(mouse, keyboard)
</code></pre></div>

The driver interface defines these functions which should be called to provide user input to Cel.
<ul>
  <li>mousemove</li>
  <li>mousewheel</li>
  <li>mousedown</li>
  <li>mouseup</li>
  <li>command</li>
  <li>char</li>
  <li>keydown</li>
  <li>keypress</li>
  <li>keyup</li>
  <li>timer</li>
</ul>

<p>The driver module should define these functions in the driver table retured by cel.installdriver.  They will
be called by cel if they are provided.
<ul>
  <li>loadfont</li>
  <li>clipboard</li>
</ul>

<p>To provide mousemove input to Cel, we have to poll the mouse position from love.
We will use a strategy that defines a function in the love.cel table to be called
by the love app from the love callback of the same name.  As a convenience we define
the callbacks if they are not already defined by the app at this point.

<h3>love.cel.update</h3> call from love.update.
<div><pre><code>
do --driver.timer, driver.mousemove
  if not love.update then
    function love.update(dt)
      love.cel.update(dt)
    end
  end

  --on each update we call mousemove and timer on the driver
  function love.cel.update(dt)
    function love.cel.update(dt)
      driver.mousemove(love.mouse.getX(), love.mouse.getY())
      driver.timer(love.timer.getTime()*1000);
    end
    
    --On the first update resize the root
    driver.root:resize(love.graphics.getWidth(), love.graphics.getHeight())
    love.cel.update(dt)
  end
end
</code></pre></div>

<h3>love.cel.mousepressed</h3>
<div><pre><code>
do --driver.mousewheel, driver.mousedown
  if not love.mousepressed then
    function love.mousepressed(...)
      return love.cel.mousepressed(...)
    end
  end

  function love.cel.mousepressed(x, y, button)
    --love treats the mousewheel like a button press
    if 'wu' == button then
      driver.mousewheel(x, y, 'wu', 1)
    elseif 'wd' == button then
      driver.mousewheel(x, y, 'wd', 1)
    else
      driver.mousedown(x, y, button)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre></div>

<h3>love.cel.mousereleased</h3>
<div><pre><code>
do 
  if not love.mousereleased then
    function love.mousereleased(...)
      return love.cel.mousereleased(...)
    end
  end

  function love.cel.mousereleased(x, y, button)
    --we have to filter wheel buttons here, cel has no concept of the wheel as a button
    if 'wu' ~= button and 'wd' ~= button then
      driver.mouseup(x, y, button)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre></div>

<h3>love.cel.keypressed</h3>
<div><pre><code>
do --driver.keydown, driver.keypress, driver.char, driver.command
  if not love.keypressed then
    function love.keypressed(...)
      return love.cel.keypressed(...)
    end
  end

  function love.cel.keypressed(key, unicode)
    --love does not distinguish a keypress and keydown event, so check cel keyboard to see
    --if the key is already down, if so send the keypress instead of keydown
    if cel.keyboard:isdown(key) then
      driver.keydown(key)
    else
      driver.keypress(key)
    end

    local isDown = love.keyboard.isDown

    --send copy/cut/paste commands, using standard windows keys, love does not abstract
    --this so we have to interpret.
    if isDown('lctrl') or isDown('rctrl') then
      if key == 'c' then
        driver.command('copy')
        return
      elseif key == 'x' then
        driver.command('cut')
        return
      elseif key == 'v' then
        driver.command('paste')
        return
      end
    end

    --get the char for the unicode and pass to driver.char
    --restricting the codeset used becuase love font does not 
    --handle others well
    if unicode <= 255 and unicode >= 32 then
      driver.char(string.char(unicode))
    end
  end
end
</code></pre></div>


<h3>love.cel.keyreleased</h3>
<div><pre><code>
do --driver.keyup
  if not love.keyreleased then
    function love.keyreleased(...)
      return love.cel.keyreleased(...)
    end
  end

  function love.cel.keyreleased(key)
    driver.keyup(key)
  end
end
</code></pre></div>

<h3>love.cel.draw</h3>
<p>Call from love.draw.  Cel does not draw itself, and has no concept of drawing
primitives such as images, polygons, lines, etc.  The host app must render, and
is free to do so however seems best.  Cel provides a description of a cel, which
includes all the information necessary to draw a cel.  See the rendering section.
<div><pre><code>
do --draw
  if not love.draw then
    function love.draw()
      love.cel.draw()
    end
  end

  --cel.describe will returns a table containing a description of what the visible
  --cels, and true if this table is not identical to the last table returned.
  function love.cel.draw()
    local t, refresh = cel.describe()
    t.drawtimestamp = cel.timer() --TODO don't put timestamp in here
    t.description.face:draw(t.description)
  end
end
</code></pre></div>

<h3>loadfont</h3>

<p>This is where embedding gets the most difficult if you don't already have decent
font rendering/metrics.  Cel does not provide this, but expcets some basic font metrics, 
they may seem complex, and it is, but doesn't even scratch the surface of the real 
complexity involved with proper glyph rendering.


<div><pre><code>
love.graphics.setFont(12) --TODO don't do this, don't remeber exactly why i had to do it initally, but
--this is not a nice thing to do
</code></pre></div>

<p>The driver is required to implement the loadfont function.  cel.loadfont() will
call driver.loadfont to create a new font.  When a font is loaded through cel.loadfont()
it caches the result, so it is unecesasry to do this in the driver implementation.

Then name of the font passed to loadfont is unrestricted, the cel demos use 4
names, so implementing these names is a good idea if you want to run the demos:
<ul>
  <li>code - should be a monospace font that is well suited for coding with</li>
  <li>monospace - a monspace font</li>
  <li>serif - a serif font like times new roman</li>
  <li>sansserif - a sans serif font like arial</li>
</ul>

loadfont should return a new font object as a table with the follwing entries:
<ul>
  <li>bbox - a table that describes a tight bounding box around the inked portion of all glyphs in the font.
                   See freetype FT_Face.bbox
    <ul> 
      <li>xmin - distance from the pen origin to the left-most inked portion of any glyph in the font</li>
      <li>xmax - distance from the pen origin to the right-most inked portion of any glyph in the font</li>
      <li>ymin - distance from the pen origin to the bottom-most inked portion of any glyph in the font(usually negative)</li>
      <li>ymax - distance from the pen origin to the top-most inked portion of any glyph in the font</li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
  <li>lineheight - See freetype FT_Face.height </li>
  <li>ascent - See freetype FT_Face.ascender</li>
  <li>descent - See freetype FT_Face.descender</li>
  <li>metrics - a table with an entry for each glyph in the font (in a future version this will be a unicode value, for now it is implemented as the value of string.byte('a') where 'a' is the charater the glyph represents. 
    <ul>
      <li>glyph - the value of string.byte() for the corresponding char</li> 
      <li>char - the value of string.char() for the corresponding glyph</li> 
      <li>advance - the horizontal advance of the pen when this glyph is drawn</li> 
      <li>xmin - distance from the pen origin to the left-most inked portion of the glyph</li>
      <li>xmax - distance from the pen origin to the right-most inked portion of the glyph</li>
      <li>ymin - distance from the pen origin to the bottom-most inked portion of the glyph</li>
      <li>ymax - distance from the pen origin to the top-most inked portion of the glyph</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A font returned from load font will be included in the description of a cel that uses the font.
For that reason you should also include any additional information in the font that will be needed
for your renderer.  For love, we store a reference to the love font retruned by love.graphics.newFont().

<p>Love does not give us the font metrics we need to work with, but it gives us some and we can fudge the 
others.  The result of this fudging will be imperfect alignment of the glyphs when cel makes measurements.
It is not unusual to have minimal font metrics, and cel is designed with this is mind, as you will see later.
<div><pre><code>
do --driver.loadfont
  --map demo font names to location of fonts in love directory
  local namemap = {
    code = 'fonts/cour.ttf',
    monospace = 'fonts/cour.ttf',
    serif = 'fonts/Anonymous Pro.ttf',
    sansserif = 'fonts/VeraMono.ttf',
  }

  --name is an unrestricted value
  --weight will be either 'normal' or 'bold'
  --slant will be either 'normal' or 'italic' or 'oblique'
  --size is the fonts size in pixels (size of what exactly is up to the driver to decide
  --a sensible choice is the size of the em square)
  function driver.loadfont(name, weight, slant, size)
    name = namemap[name]

    local font = {}

    --create a love font and store it as font.nativefont to be used by our renderer
    if name then
      font.nativefont = love.graphics.newFont(name, size)
    else
      font.nativefont = love.graphics.newFont(size)
    end

    local nativeheight = font.nativefont:getHeight()
    do --calculate font bbox, love does not provide most of the metrics that cel requires, 
       --but we can still make it work by guessing picking reasonable values based on the
       --font metrics is does provide.  The most important metric for cel is the advance,
       --love does supply that metric.  These can be tweaked based on the font through trial
       --and error, or you can use outside means, such as freetype to store the metrics in 
       --a file.
      font.bbox = {
        xmin = 0,
        xmax = 0,
        ymin = -(nativeheight - math.floor(nativeheight * .8)), --fudge it
        ymax = math.floor(nativeheight * .8), --fudge it
      }
    end

    font.lineheight = font.nativefont:getHeight()
    font.ascent = font.bbox.ymax
    font.descent = -font.bbox.ymin

    local function newglyph(fontmetrics, glyph)
      local char = string.char(glyph)
      --no glyph metrics from love, we can get the horizontal advance at least
      local xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax = 0, font.nativefont:getWidth(char), font.bbox.ymin, font.bbox.ymax

      fontmetrics[glyph] = {
        glyph = glyph,
        char = char,
        advance = font.nativefont:getWidth(char),
        xmin = xmin,
        xmax = xmax,
        ymin = ymin,
        ymax = ymax,
      }

      return fontmetrics[glyph]
    end

    --Don't calculate the glyph metrics until it is asked for.
    font.metrics = setmetatable({}, {__index = newglyph}) 

    return font 
  end
end
</code></pre></div>

<p>We set the key repeat, by default it is off in love.  Not very nice of our driver.
<div><pre><code>
love.keyboard.setKeyRepeat(450, 35)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Our driver will return a cel to be used as the root cel for the love app.  We don't
return the real root cel because we want our driver to have sole control of it.  You don't
have to understand this right now, you will after going through the tutorials on linking.
<div><pre><code>
return driver.root:newroot():link(driver.root, 'edges')
</code></pre></div>

<h1>The rendering module</h1>

<p>This module will define how we render a cel.  The approach taken here is just one way to do
it, how you choose to render will depend on the rendering capabilitis you have available.
</body>

<div><pre><code>
local cel = require 'cel' 
</code></pre></div>

<p>Lets take a look at the information provided in a cel description.  The description is obtained
by calling cel.describe().

<ul>The description starts with general information that is unrelated to a particular cel.
  <li>count - This is incremented each time a new description is returned from cel.describe()</li>
  <li>timer - The value returned from cel.timer() when the description is generated.</li>
  <li>root - This is the description of the root cel.  All other cel descriptions will be ancestors of this description</li>
</ul>

<ul>Every cel description will have the following entrys
  <li>id - a unique id for the cel the cel that is described, this is 0 if the cel has no id (meaning its a virtual cel)</li>
  <li>host - refers to the parent descrition</li>
  <li>x - The absolute x coordinate of the cel.  Absolute means not relative to its host cel</li>
  <li>y - The absolute y coordinate of the cel.</li>
  <li>w - The width of the cel</li>
  <li>h - The height of the cel</li>
  <li>mousefocus - Indicates the mouse focus, will be one of these values:
    <ul>
      <li>false - This is the default value, indicating the mouse cursor is not in the cel</li>
      <li>true - the mouse cursor is in the cel</li>
      <li>1 - the mouse cursor is in the cel, and is directly over the cel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the description of the white cel mousefocus would be 1.  For the red, blue and green cels it would be true.</p>
    <img src='mousefocus.png'/>
  </li>
  <li>keyboardfocus - Indicates the keyboard focus, follows the same pattern as mousefocus and will be one of these values:
    <ul>
      <li>false - This is the default value, indicating the cel does not have focus</li>
      <li>true - the cel has focus, but another cel has primary</li>
      <li>1 - the cel has primary focus, meaning it is the first to receive events.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>flowcontext - This is nil by default, if present this cel is 'flowing' and this is the context
  passed to the flow function.  The flow function can put additional information in the context, the suggested usage
  is event based animations.</li>
  <li>clip - a table that defines a rectangle in absolute coordinates, that the cel is cliped to.
    <ul>
      <li>l - The left of the clipping rectangle, this is always less than the right</li>
      <li>r - The right of the clipping rectangle this is always greater than the left side</li>
      <li>t - The top of the clipping rectangle, this is always less than the bottom.</li>
      <li>b - the bottom of the clipping rectangle, this is always greater than the top.</li>
    </ul>
    If the clipping rectangles area is 0 then that means the cel is not on the screen, and it is not described.
  </li>
  <li>face - This is the face of the cel.  A cel is assigned a face when it is created.  The face serves as a bridge between the renderer and the cel implementation.  See below for further explanation of what a face is.</li>
  <li>metacel - This is the name of the metacel for the cel.  The metacel is basically the type of cel such as 'button', 'label', 'listbox', 'root'</li>
  <li>[1-n] - This is the array portion of the cels description, (it meets the requirements for the #operator to return its length).  Any cel that is linked to the cell and is not entirely clipped will be in this array in z order.  (The topmost link will be at index 1).  For cels that define a layout, such as a sequence, the order is not based on z order</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an example description that of Fig 1.
<div><pre><code>
--TODO capture this and paste it in here
</code></pre></div>

<h2>What is a cel face</h2>
<p>A cel face is a place for the renderer to store information that it needs to render a cel.  A single face can be shared by multiple cels or a cel can have its own unique face.  In most cases though you would have a face that is used for buttons, another for listboxes, another for labels and so on.

<p>The renderer is a good place to define faces, but doesn't have to be the only place.  
This is how you create a face:
<div><pre><code>
local face = cel.face {
  metacel = 'cel'
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>We just defined a face that can be used by any cel ('cel' is the name of the default metacel, all other cels 'inherit' from the 'cel' metacel).  The metacel entry indicates what metacel this face is for.

<p>Lets add something to the face that we can use to render the cel, like a color<p>
<div><pre><code>
local face = cel.face {
  metacel = 'cel',
  color = 'red',
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now when we see a face in the description our renderer can get the color out of the face and use that when rendering the cel.  An important point is that Cel does not care what the color is, nor does it understand the meaning of the color entry in the face, this definition is something that your renderer and app understand.  

There are some entries that cel does understand, and defines the meaning of.  These entries are reserved by Cel:
<ul>
  <li>font - if present this should be a font returned from cel.loadfont()</li>
  <li>layout - if present this should be a table describing the layout of the cel, each metacel will define its own
  layout.</li>
  <li>flow - if present this should be a table of flow functions, the metacel will define the names to use and what they mean.
</ul>

<p>I will go into a deeper explanation of font, layout and flow later.  Any properties in the 'cel' metacel face are also properties of other faces (via __index metamethod).  

<p>This defines a face for a button.  The <code>metacel = 'button'</code> entry is what makes it a button face.
<div><pre><code>
local buttonface = cel.face {
  metacel = 'button',
  bordercolor = 'blue',
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>A 'button' metacel inherits from the 'cel' metacel (as do all cels).  The face defined for a metacel will inherit properties of the face defined for the metacel it inherits from.  In this case <code>buttonface.color == 'red'</code>
<p>This define a face for a textbutton.  The textbutton metacel inherits from the button metacel.

<div><pre><code>
local textbuttonface = cel.face {
  metacel = 'textbutton',
  color = 'green',
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>textbuttonface inherits bordercolor from buttonface but overrides the color.  If there was no entry for color in the textbuttonface then it would use the value from the 'cel' face.

<p>It is many times necessary to define multiple faces for the same metacel, for instance if we want buttons to 
be different colors.  To do that you have to give the face a name like this:
<div><pre><code>
local purplebuttonface = cel.face {  
  metacel = 'button',
  name = 'purplebutton'
  color = 'purple',
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that <code>buttonface</code> was not given a name, what a face does not have a name it becomes the face for the metacel and any other face for that metacel will inherit properties from it.  So in this case <code>purplebuttonface.bordercolor == 'blue'</code>

<p>If a button is created like this:
<code>local button = cel.button.new(100, 100)</code> then it will use the unnamed face for the button metacel.  To create a button with an alternate face, you can pass it in as the last parameter like this:<code>local button = cel.button.new(100, 100, 'purplebutton')</code>.  When the button is created it will lookup a face with the name purplebutton.  You can also pass a reference to the face directly like this:<code>local button = cel.button.new(100, 100, purplebuttonface)</code>.  In addition the name of a face is not restricted to a string, which is useful for creating private faces.

TODO explain when face inheritance happens, not when it is created but wehn the metacel is created.

<h2>Using faces in the renderer</h2>
<p>This example renderer will use the painters algorithm to render each cel, we start by drawing the root cel and then
any will go through the cel descriptions from bottom to top(from n to 1) drawing each one.  

<p>We will start by defining the face for the 'cel' metacel, any properties we put in here will be available to all other faces.
<code><pre>
local face = cel.face {
  --metacel = 'cel', this is the default metacel, we don't have to specify it
  font = cel.loadfont(),
  textcolor = cel.color.rgb(255, 255, 255),
  fillcolor = cel.color.rgb(200, 200, 200),
  linecolor = cel.color.rgb(200, 200, 200),
}
</pre></code>
By defining a font in the 'cel' face we are settting the font for every label, textbutton, text, edtibox, etc. that will be created. The font entry is one of the entries reserved by Cel.  When a cel is created that needs a font, it will look for and expect to find the font in its face.  By calling cel.loadfont() with no arguments we are asking for the default font provided by the driver.

<p>The 3 ****color entries are ignored by Cel, but the we want to run the demo and the demo apps will use these names to specify colors for some cels.  When you create your own faces for your app, you may decide to not use this approach. The next step is to draw a cel based on its description when using this face.

<code><pre>
--this function sets the current color, the color argument is a 4 byte string with each byte representing red, green, blue, alpha respectively.  Take note of when we return true or false.
local function setcolor(color)
  if not color then return false end
  local r, g, b, a = cel.color.decode(color)
  if a == 0 then return false end
  love.graphics.setColor(r, g, b, a)
  return true
end

--this function clips our drawing to the the retangle defined by t, 
--t is expected to be in the format of the clip table from a cel description.
local function clip(t)  
  love.graphics.setScissor(t.l, t.t, t.r-t.l, t.b-t.t)

The printstring function sets the font and prints the specified text, x, y is the pen location, i, j
is the portion of the text to render.
Love prints from the upperleft corner of the the font.bbox (font.bbox becuase our
driver defines font.bbox in terms of font.nativefont:getHeight())
We don't need to adjust for penx only becuase our font metrics are bad and we
know font.bbox.xmin is always 0.
i, j are the substring of the text we want to render.  Ideally love.graphics.print
would allow us to pass these in without haveing to create the substring.  Hopefully
a future version will expose that type of api.  An ideal api(for rendering Cel) would expose a print function
that allows specifying the pen origin along with a the substring of the text to render.
<code><pre>
local function printstring(font, x, y, text, i, j)
  love.graphics.setFont(font.nativefont)
  if i then text = text:sub(i, j) end
  return love.graphics.print(text, x, y - font.bbox.ymax)
end

The drawlinks function is the implementation of the painters algorithm, 
the argument t is a cel description, for each linked cel in the description
we call the draw function of its face, with its description.  This means we 
need to make sure each face has a draw function, so we will create one in the 
root face.  TODO explain that root face is not the face of the the root cel, but
the 'cel' metacel face that all other faces inherit from.
<code><pre>
local function drawlinks(t)
  for i = #t,1,-1 do
    local t = t[i]
    t.face:draw(t)
  end
end
</pre></code>

<p>This is the draw function that all faces will use (unless they redefine it).  Notice
that it will draw colors if they are set.  When the face is done drawing it calls drawlinks.
<code><pre>
function face:draw(t)
  if self.color then
    if setcolor(self.color) then
      clip(t.clip)
      fillrect(t.x, t.y, t.w, t.h)
    else
      if setcolor(self.fillcolor) then
        clip(t.clip)
        fillrect(t.x, t.y, t.w, t.h)
      end
      if setcolor(self.linecolor) then
        clip(t.clip)
        strokerect(t.x, t.y, t.w, t.h)
      end
    end
  else

  end
  return drawlinks(t)
end
</pre></code>
