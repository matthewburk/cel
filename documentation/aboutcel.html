<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>A cel ([c]ontrol [el]ement) is the basic unit or building block of
the Cel library. To use the libarry effectively you must understand
what a cel is as well as what it can and can't do. A cel is the
equivalent of a widget. A cel aggregates user input events, and will
normally be rendered to the screen.</p>

<h2>the cel rectangle</h2>

<p>A cel is a rectangle cel.x is the left of the rectangle, cel.y is
the top, cel.w is the width and cel.h is the height. The orgin of a
cels coordinate system is at the top left corner of the cel, x
increases to the right and y increases down. The right of a cel is
cel.x + cel.w, and the bottom is cel.y + cel.h. A cel contains all
points where <code>x &gt;= 0</code> and <code>x &lt; cel.w</code> and
<code>y &gt;=0</code> and <code>y &lt; cel.h</code>. This set can be
restricted but not increased.</p>

<h2>hosts and links</h2>

<p><em>All</em> cels are containers. This means that any cel (with the
exception of the root cel) can be put into any other cel. Furthermore
the contaier/containee relationship is fully dynamic and can be changed
easily. This heirarchy or cel tree starts with the root cel (obvious, i
know). Often this root cel would be called a parent, and the cels that
it contains would be called its children. This is not the terminology
used by Cel because parent/child implies that the parent creates the
child and that the relationship is fixed. To highlight that the
relationship is mutable the parent is called the host and the child a
link (because it is linked to the host). When reading the
documentation, up the cel tree means towards the root of the tree. From
here on out the terms host and link will be used.</p>


<h2>composite cels</h2>

<p>A composite cel is a cel that is composed from other cels. The host
cel is called the composite cel and any cels that are <em>created</em>
by it are called component cels. The created distinction is important,
a cel that is linked to the composite cel is not considered a component
cel if it was not created by the composite cel. Typically a composite
cel will encapsulate its component cels.</p>

<h2>Goals - the requirements that shaped the Cel library</h2>

<p>Cels design is influenced by these requirements: </p>

<h3>Embeddability</h3>

The prime requirement of Cel is it should be embeddable. Meaning
embedding Cel in a host process that uses it and controls it. This
implies that the requirements for a suitable host should be minimal.
This requirement is why Cel is passive, the host process always tells
Cel when and how to act. Cel also does not render anything, nor does it
define a pattern for rendering, rendering is the job of the host
process.
<h3>Easy to use</h3>

This is just a bit less important than the prime requirement. Easy to
use is the whole point of an api in the first place (well at least for
a high-level api like Cel). My view is that there are endless ways to
achieve the same result, an api is a path to that result. Adding
features can make an api easier to use or harder to use, most of the
time a feature will make some things easier and some harder. Makeing
those decisions is the art of api programming, there is no formula.
<p>Easy to use means different things depending on the type of user.
Cel is targeted to three types of users: </p>

<ol>

  <li> The platform(like Love) programmer who has all the basic
ingredients for a gui, such as mouse and keyboard input, and rendering
capabilites. There are literrally hundreds of these platforms, each
custom made and lovingly crafted. Many of them have primitive gui
support (becuase its more work than it seems). I want them all to use
Cel, and I want Cel to be a natural fit for their platform so that they
want to use it. This means providing what they don't have, and not what
they do, which is why Cel does not render. </li>
  <li> The gui programmer. This could be a programmer using a platform
or the platform programmer. If these guys don't like Cel, then the
platform programmer will not want to offer it. This programmer is the
true test of the api, and most of the api design favors making this
user happy, sometimes at the cost of the platform programmer. </li>
  <li>The user interacting with gui. This means full featured controls,
for example a scrollbar that works as expected, not a watered down
shell of what we are all familiar with using. </li>
</ol>


<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>All of the requirements have priority over speed. I'm not saying
speed is not important, it is very important but a high-level api is
the antithesis of speed. Speed is the easiest goal to achieve, simply
reduce features and/or write it in assembly. The job of an api is to
make good tradeoffs between execution speed and ease of use. Obviously
what ends up on the screen can be done another way with a different set
of tradeoffs. </p>

<h2>Sandboxing</h2>

<p>TODO</p>

<h2>Derived Requirements</h2>

<p>These requirements are aimed at making Cel easy to use without
breaking the prime requirement of embedability.</p>

<h3>No special cases</h3>

<p>There should be no special cases or special cels that are allowed to
break the rules. Special cases really just leads to special cases gone
wild, which leads to ???, which leads to suffering. This is an ideal,
but alas the root cel is special becuase it cannot link or be unlinked.</p>

<h3>Text metrics and display</h3>

<p>Cel should have halfway decent text output, meaning support for
basic font metrics. Ideally it would just give you beautiful font
rendering (becuase its not fun or easy to roll your own). Unfortunately
I could not achieve this becuase it would be a large hurdle to
embedability. Cel, instead, attempts to ease the burden of dealing with
text.</p>

<h3>Automatic layout</h3>

<p>Automatic layout is a requirement, that I originally assumed would
not be. After all, what could be easier that settting x,y,width,height
for a rectangle, right? Well I tried that, then I tried to make a demo,
and the simplest things (like a list of textbuttons equal width and
height) were just too hard to do. I had to make sure i knew the longest
string I wanted to display and if those strings changed, i had to react
someway. This was all part of the demo, I was adding automatic layout
in the demo app itself to work around these problems. This was one of
those times I had to admit defeat and admit automatic layout is a
requirement for 'easy to use'.</p>

<p>I was not thrilled with automatic layout in any gui library I had
used before, if the layout was flexible it wasn't easy, if it was easy
it was not flexible. Cel has automatic layout built into every cel, and
you will use it without even realizeing it.</p>

<h3>A mutable cel tree</h3>

<p>The primary functions to enable this are cel:link() and
cel:unlink(). If you have a cel, linking it to another cel is <em>always</em>
ok, and 'just works', and the same goes for unlinking. Having to manage
when you can and cannot do this and what cels go with what other cels
would be a nightmare, worse than memory management. So Cel doesn't
require that you do, and to enable this encapsulation is necessary.</p>

<h3>Encapsulation</h3>

<p>A cel has many properties that are not exposed outside of the core
library, these are considered implementation details in some cases, but
it is mostly done so that things 'just work'. Any derived cel can use
the same techniques that Cel uses to achieve encapsulation. </p>

<p>The cel tree cannot be queried or walked. This means there is no way
to get the host of a cel or get the links of a cel. <em>There is no
method that exposes a cel that the application did not create.</em>
This means there is no way to get the cel with focus, or under the
mouse etc. You may think that it is too restrictive, but the effect is
the opposite. Putting a window in a listbox, or an editbox in a listbox
or a label in a listbox are all identical operations, and this is
largely enabled by encapsulation.</p>

<p>Cel doesn't actively enforce encapsulation, but it does enable it by
not exposing cels. Cel does not expose cels is becuase the cel tree is
mutable (which is highly desireable). Here is an partial list of
intentionally ommited functionality:</p>

<ul>

  <li><code>cel:gethost()</code></li>
  <li><code>cel:getlinks()</code></li>
  <li><code>cel.getcelwithfocus()</code></li>
  <li><code>cel.getcelatxy(x,y)</code></li>
  <li><code>cel.getbyid(id)</code></li>
</ul>

<p> <em>A composite cel should be able to assert full control of the
layout and lifecycle of its component cels.</em> The ability to peek
into or walk the cel tree means creating a composite cel is too hard,
and the end result will be too fragile. To illustrate the problem I'll
use the window cel. A window has a handle to drag the window around
with, this handle is actually another cel that the window encapsulates.
What can a window do to ensure that this cel is not unlinked? One
option would be to set a property on the cel and prevent unlinking if
this property is set, but that solution is a hack and would lead to
uncertainty and an endless number of special cases. If I as the gui
programmer unlink a cel, I expect it to happen, period. Cel enables
encapsulation so that you can hide cels you need full control of. The
functionality lost by this encapsulation is regained through the link()
and relink() functions. For example how does one add a button to the
window handle, if you can't link to it? Enabling that type of
functionality is what guided the desing of the link(), relink() and
__link(). How does one alter the properties of the handle, for instance
its size, appearance, etc? Enabling that type of functionality is what <em>initially</em>
guided the design of cel faces.</p>

<h3>Separation of concerns</h3>

<p>When creating a gui the look is very important. Specifying the
functionality of a cel, and how the app reacts to events is a concern
that is largely orthogonal to how the cel looks. Defining this
separation is especially important to Cel because it has no rendering
capabilites. Cel enables this separation through cel faces. A face is
the context available to the renderer and is associated to a cel at
creation. Besides seperating functionality from appearance this has
several other advantages. </p>

<p>To illustrate I will show the bad, but not uncommon way this is done
in many gui libraries. This is the bad way: </p>

<pre><code><br>    button = cel.button.new(10, 10)<br>    button.setcolor('blue')<br>    button.setbordersize(2)<br>    button.setactivatecolor('green')<br>  </code></pre>

Identifying a cel semantically is better:
<pre><code><br>    button = cel.button.new(10, 10, 'invetory button')<br>  </code></pre>


<ul>

Why is the bad way bad?
  <li>The most common scenario is a bunch of buttons will look the
same, they will have the same colors or images etc. Repeating this for
each identical looking button is just noise. This puts the burden on
the app programmer to create specialized generators, or overly long
constructors to prevent repeating themselves. </li>
  <li>Its an unecessary waste of space, storing the same information
for each button. There is no workaround to fix this issue. </li>
  <li>It ends up being too hard to change, and enforcing a common theme
is an added task for the app programmer.</li>
  <li>It presents a barrier to simultaneous work, as in
artist/programmer working independently</li>
</ul>

<p> The better way addresses all of these problems. One recently
popular way to do this is to copy html/css type of functionality. There
is certainly wisdom and good design happening there, but a gui does not
occupy the same space as html, it doesn't have an abundance of content,
and layout is often an integral part of the functionality of the gui.
Cel faces have some similarity to this model, but is targeted to the
needs of a typical gui, not a document. </p>

<h3>Reuse through inheritance</h3>

<p>Composition inheritance has already been discussed, that is what a
composite cel is. Composition inheritance is best, but sometimes
implementation inheritance is useful. Cel does support implementation
inheritance, but it should not be your first choice when creating a new
type of cel. The main reason is that implementation inheritance is too
fragile and some people view it as an is-a relationship which is only
sometimes true. A hallmark of implementation inheritance is overriding
existing methods, this is also where you will get into trouble if you
are not <em>very</em> careful. Adding to the implementation without
overriding is much less fragile, but you can get that through
composition. So implementation inheritance is really only useful for
overriding or indicating the is-a relationship (but overriding can turn
the is-a relationship off imo). To override a function or property(in a
way the parent did not anticipate) using implementation inheritance
requires knowledge of the internal workings of the parent. It works
well in a cohesive pacakge, or when you already have a full
understanding of the parent implementation details.</p>

<p>How can overriding change the is-a relationship you ask? Well
changing a defining characteristic will do it imo. A Cel label has the
characteristic that it can't be touched, as if it is etched into its
host cel. If I overrode that behavior, and let it be touched the new
cel is no longer a label, becuase it is not a drop in replacement for a
label in every circumstance. The built-in Cel controls do exactly this
kind of overriding, do not make the assumption that the is-a
relationship is true just because implementation inheritance is used.
The relationship will be stated in the documentation. By convention
is-a cel will be true for any type of cel.</p>

<p>If implementation inheritance is so bad what does Cel use it? The
reason is because its useful, the code reuse is real, <em>and you can
expose a private interface to the inheriting cel.</em> Through
alternate interface you can enable more dangerous but useful functions.
They can be more dangerous becuase there use can be segregated. A cel
could be created that does something wrong, that has erratic behavior,
or crashes, etc. Simple solution don't use it, or maybe even fix it in
that one place. If these useful but dangerous functions were exposed to
any instance of any cel the problem becomes much bigger. What makes a
function dangerous? Well there is no formula for that, sorry. </p>

<p>Cel takes a pragmatic approach to this. Use the public interface and
its easy going, use the private interface and you are trusted and take
on a higher level of responsibility. The private interface is a part of
the metacel. The Cel documentation will instruct you on how it expects
this interface to be used. Deviating from those expectaions is not
advised.</p>

<h2>metacels</h2>

A metacel is used to define a new type of cel.&nbsp; A metacel defines
a function to create a cel, and has a more privledged position in the
Cel library than a cel.&nbsp; 
A new metacel is created with cel.newmetacel('name') where name is the
name of the new metacel.&nbsp; A new metacel is a copy of an existing
metacel.&nbsp; The cel metacel defines these functions:<br>

<ul>

  <li>metacel:new(...) to create a new cel.</li>
  <li>metacel:compile() to create a new cel from a table definition.</li>
  <li>metacel:newmetacel() to copy this metacel.</li>
  <li>metacel:newfactory() to create a factory for the metacel, which
allows cel to be created without exposing the metacel.</li>
  <li>metacel:getface() to resolve a face for this metacel.</li>
  <li>metacel:setlimits() to set the minimum and maximum dimensions of
a cel.</li>
</ul>
The cel metacel defines these behavior
altering methods<br>

<ul>

<li>metacel:__link() to react when a link is made and change how or
where the link is made.<br>
</li>
<li>metacel:__relink() to react when a link is relinked.<br>
</li>
<li>metacel:__unlink() to react when a link is unlinked<br>
</li>
<li>metacel:__resize() to react when a cel is resized<br>
</li>
  <li>metacel:__linkmove() to react when a link moves.</li>
  <li>metacel:__describe() to describe the cel for rendering.<br>
  </li>

</ul>
A metacel can define an event callback function for all of the standard events, and will always receive events before the cel.<br>
<br>
A new metacel aslo has a new copy of a metatable stored at
metacel.metatable.&nbsp; This metatable is the metatable shared by all
cels created though metacel:new().&nbsp; The metatable is the public
interface of the cel. The cel metatable defines these functions:<br>

<ul>

  <li><code>cel:link()</code> to link the cel to a host cel.</li>
  <li><code>cel:relink()</code> to change the link relationship.</li>
  <li><code>cel:unlink()</code> to unlink from a host cel.</li>
  <li><code>cel:raise(), cel:sink()</code> to change cels z order.<br>
  </li>
  <li><code>cel:disable()</code> to make the cel unresponsive to user
input.</li>
  <li><code>cel:enable()</code> to make the cel responsive to user
input.</li>
  <li><code>cel:pget()</code> to get properties of the cel by name.</li>
  <li><code>cel:getface()</code> to get the face of the cel.</li>
  <li><code>cel:move(), cel:moveby(), cel:resize() </code>to mutate
the cel rectangle.</li>
  <li><code>cel:takefocus(), cel:hasfocus()</code> to manage user focus.<br>
  </li>
  <li><code>cel:islinkedto(), cel:islinkedtoroot()</code>.</li>
  <li><code>cel:trapmouse(), cel:hasmousetrapped(), cel:freemouse()</code>.</li>
  <li><code>cel:flow*()</code> to animate the cel.</li>
</ul>

These functions should not be overridden, and in a future release this
may be enforced through a proxy or userdata.<br>
<br>

The metacel should be kept private, the recommended way to do this
is with a module.&nbsp; The dominate pattern used in Cel to define a new metacel is this:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>local cel = require 'cel'</code><br>
<code>local metacel, metatable = cel.newmetacel('foo')</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>--do this for each new public function</code><br>
<code>function metatable:myfunc(a, b, c)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --self is the cel</code><br>
<code>end</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>--define event callbacks on the metacel</code><br>
<code>function metacel:onmousedown(foo, button, x, y, intercepted)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --do somthing</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return true</code><br>
<code>end</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>--add to description</code><br>
<code>function metacel:__describe(t)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t.fooproperty = 'a foo property'</code><br>
<code>end</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>do</code><br>
<code>&nbsp; local _new = metacel.new</code><br>
<code>&nbsp; function metacel:new(w, h, face)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --ensure we have a valid face for the metacel</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face = self:getface(face)&nbsp; </code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local foo = _new(self, w, h, face)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --do foo setup</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return foo</code><br>
<code>&nbsp; end</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>&nbsp; local _compile = metacel.compile</code><br>
<code>&nbsp; function metacel:compile(t, foo)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foo = foo or metacel:new(t.w, t.h, t.face)&nbsp;&nbsp;  </code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return _compile(self, t, foo)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp; end</code><br>
<code>end</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>return metacel:newfactory()</code><br>
<code></code></div>
<code><br>
</code>When Cel is put on a new platform, it may be convenient to define a metcel that is platform specific, such as an image cel.<br>

<h2>faces</h2>
A cel face is a context for the renderer to store information that it
needs to render a cel. A single face can be shared by multiple cels or
a cel can have its own unique face. In most cases though you would have
a face that is used for buttons, another for listboxes, another for
labels and so on.<br>
<br>
This is how you create a face:<br>
<code>local blueface = cel.face {<br>
&nbsp; metacel = 'cel',<br>
&nbsp; name = 'blue',<br>
}</code><br>
<br>
Cel associates a face to a metacel based on the name of the
metacel.&nbsp; The face in the example is for the 'cel' metacel, which
all other metacels are derived from.&nbsp; Calling cel.face with a
table definition will first look for a face with the metacel and name
specified.&nbsp; If an existing face is not found then it is created.
&nbsp; All other entries in the table definition copied to the
face.&nbsp; The face is a table with a protected metatable managed by
Cel.&nbsp; What goes in the face is determined by the platform Cel is
embedded in, I am going to use colors for illustrative purposes.&nbsp;
Adding a color to a face is easy.<br>
<br>
This method finds the existinng face and add the new field to it:<br>
<code>cel.face {<br>
&nbsp; metacel = 'cel',<br>
&nbsp; name = 'blue',<br>
&nbsp; color = cel.color.rgb(0, 0, 1),<br>
}</code><br>
<br>
This method writes to the face directly:<br>
<code>blueface.linecolor = cel.color.rgb(0, 0, 0)</code><br>
<br>
At this point blueface has an entry for fillcolor and linecolor. <br>
<br>
If you want to remove any entry from a face, this will not work:<br>
<code>cel.face {<br>

&nbsp; metacel = 'cel',<br>

&nbsp; name = 'blue',<br>

&nbsp; </code><code>color</code><code> = cel.color.rgb(0, 0, 1),<br>
&nbsp; linecolor = nil,<br>

}<br>
<br>
</code>To remove it you must do this:<br>
<code>blueface.linecolor = nil.</code><br>
<br>
Now when we see a face in the description our renderer can get the
color from the face and use that when rendering the cel. An important
point is that Cel does not care what the color is, nor does it
understand the meaning of the color entry in the face, this definition
is something that your renderer and app understand. There are some
entries that cel does understand, and defines the meaning of. These
entries are reserved by Cel:<br>
<ul>
  <li>

font - if present this should be a font returned from cel.loadfont()</li>
  <li>

layout - if present this should be a table describing the layout of the cel, each metacel will define its own layout if any.</li>
  <li>

flow - if present this should be a table of flow functions, the metacel will define the names to use and what they mean.</li>
</ul>

An face name is not required, an unamed face is identified only by the
metacel, and is called the metacel face.&nbsp; The metacel face can be
accessed like this:<br>
<code>local celface = cel.face {<br>
&nbsp; metacel = 'cel',<br>
&nbsp; --notice a name is not specified<br>
&nbsp; draw = function(face, description) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local color = face.color or cel.color.rgb(1, 1, 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fillrect(description.x, description.y, description.w, description.h, color)<br>
&nbsp; end<br>
}</code><br>
<br>
We just a defined draw function in the cel metacel face (fillrect is a
hypothetical function).&nbsp; It looks for a color in the face and uses
that color when drawing the cel rectangle.<br>
If a named face does not have an entry then the metacel face is
checked. In other words any entries in the metacel face are also
availabe to named faces (via __index metamethod). <br>
<br>
This defines a face for a button. The metacel = 'button' entry is what makes it a button face.<br>
<code>local buttonface = cel.face {<br>

&nbsp; metacel = 'button',<br>

&nbsp; bordercolor = cel.color.rgb(1, 1, 1),<br>

}<br>
<br>
</code>Because a button is a cel, the button metacel face will also
inherit from the cel metacel face, and a named button face will inherit
from the button metacel.&nbsp; This means that buttonface.draw ==
celface.draw.<br>
Of course a button will not normally look like a flat cel, so you
should give the button metacel its own draw function, this draw
function can use the extra information a button provides in its
description and<br>
any extra information from a button face.<br>
<br>
<code>function buttonface:draw(t)<br>
&nbsp; --self is the face, t is the button description<br>
&nbsp; </code><code>local color = self.color<br>&nbsp; fillrect(t.x, t.y, t.w, t.h, color)<br>
&nbsp; local bordercolor = self.bordercolor<br>
&nbsp; strokerect(t.x, t.y, t.w, t.h, bordercolor)  <br>
end</code><br>
<br>
If a button is created like this: local button = cel.button.new(100,
100) then it will use the unnamed face for the button metacel. To
create a button with an alternate face, you can pass it in as the last
parameter like this:local button = cel.button.new(100, 100,
'purplebutton'). When the button is created it will lookup a face with
the name purplebutton. You can also pass a reference to the face
directly like this:local button = cel.button.new(100, 100,
purplebuttonface). In addition the name of a face is not restricted to
a string, which is useful for creating private faces. TODO explain when
face inheritance happens, not when it is created but wehn the metacel
is created.<br>
<br>
A cel is assigned a face when it is created.&nbsp; A metacel will locate a suitable face using the metacel:getface(face)
function, the face parameter can be either a face or its name.&nbsp; In the following example both cels have the same face:<br>

<br>
<code>
a = cel.new(20, 20, blueface)<br>

b = cel.new(20, 20, 'blue')</code><br>

<br>
Cel keeps a seperate index of faces per metacel.&nbsp; For each face
that is created it is indexed by itself and by its name, this is what
allows you to specify either the name or the face itself when creating
a cel. These are the steps in resolving the face when a cel is created:<br>
<ol>
  <li>If no face is specified the face of the creating metacel is used.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The face is looked up in the face index of the creating metacel, if found this is used.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The face is looked up in the face index of the cel metacel, if found this is used.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>The face is not a valid face for the creating metacel nor is it a
named face for teh cel metacel.&nbsp; In this case the face of the
creating metacel is used.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Notice that named faces for the cel metacel are available to all types
of cels, this is allowed because an every cel description will contain
all the conent needed to render a normal cel.<br>

<h2>events</h2>

<p>How any gui library defines and implements events is probably the
single most important feature it provides. If they are not well defined
reacting to them reliably can be a challenge. One of the pimary design
goals of Cel was to make event handling effortless and natural. This is
harder than it sounds, (especially when balanced against encapsulation
and sandboxing).&nbsp; There are two types of events in Cel,
synchronous and asynchonous.&nbsp; An event is considered synchonous if
the event handler is called when the event is generated, an
asynchronous event is put in a fifo queue and the event handler is
called when the event is taken off of the queue.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>The primary reason Cel uses asynchronous events is to allow the
event handler to be unrestricted.&nbsp; The onmousein event is a good
example.&nbsp; If onmousein were synchornous then there would have to
be these restrictions on the hadler:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not mutate the cel tree - don't link, unlink, relink, move, resize, raise, sink etc.</li>
  <li>Do not trap the mouse or change focus etc.</li>
</ul>
The reason for the restrictions is becuase the cel tree is walked as
these events are generated.&nbsp; These complications are all neatly
solved by using asynchrnous events.&nbsp; These basic cel events are
asynchronous:<br>
<ul>
  <li>onresize</li>
  <li>onmousemove</li>
  <li>onmousein</li>
  <li>oumouseout</li>
  <li>onmousedown</li>
  <li>onmouseup</li>
  <li>onmousewheel</li>
  <li>onkeydown</li>
  <li>onkeypress</li>
  <li>onkeyup</li>
  <li>onchar</li>
  <li>oncommand<br>
  </li>
  <li>ontimer</li>
  <li>onfocus</li>
</ul>
There are other pros/cons for syncrounous vs asynchrnous events which I
will not go into here.&nbsp; A normal cel has no synchronous events, an
event that is triggered by an asynchronous event should be synchronous
in most cases.&nbsp; A button defines these events which are all
syncrhonous<br>
<ul>
  <li>onpress - triggered by onmousedown</li>
  <li>onhold - triggered by ontimer</li>
  <li>onclick - triggered by onmouseup</li>
</ul>
An event handler is just a normal function, the parameters to the
function vary by event.&nbsp; Define the function on the cel to act on
the event:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>local button = cel.button.new(20, 20)</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>function button:onresize(ow, oh)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp; print('button resized', self, ow, oh)</code><br>
<code>end</code><br>
</div>
When the button is resized the onresize function will be called when
the event is taken off the event queue.&nbsp; This approach is simple
and the most common scenario.&nbsp; Using the event listener approach
is useful when multiple (decoupled) listeners need to recieve the
event.&nbsp; <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>local function acelresized(self, ow, oh)</code><br>
<code>&nbsp; print('cel', self, 'resized', ow, oh, self.w, self.h)</code><br>
<code>end</code><br>
<code></code><br>
<code>button:addlistener('onresize', acelresized)</code><br>
</div>
The listener approach is more cumbersome, and often unecessary, but it
can be useful.&nbsp; Both techniques can be used together, for a single
event the event handlers are called in this order:<br>
<ol>
  <li>The metacels on[event] function</li>
  <li>The cels on[event] function</li>
  <li>The listener functions for on[event], the order in which these are called is not defined.</li>
</ol>
There is another order to events that is important to understand.&nbsp;
When an event applies to a cel and its host, for example onmousedown,
it is always sent to the cel furthest down the cel tree first, then<br>
up the cel tree to its host (known as event bubbling).&nbsp; Cel does
not allow a host cel to prevent its links from receiving events (known
as event capturing), this is prevented to ensure that any type of cel
can be linked to any other type of cel and still function.&nbsp;
Likewise a cel cannot terminate an event.&nbsp; For events that bubble
up the cel tree a flag is sent to the event hander indicating if the
event was intercepted,&nbsp; the handler may want to alter its behavior
if the event was already intercepted.&nbsp; To intercept an event, the
event handler should return true.<br>

<h2>Why Lua</h2>

<p>This is where I say how ridiculously awesome Lua is, coming soon</p>

<h2>Areas for improvement</h2>

<ul>

  <li> Creating a new type of cel (called a metacel) should be easy.
Its not as easy as I wanted it to be. </li>
  <li> Extending a cel (other than a basic cel) pretty much requires
knowledge of what the original cel is doing, meaning reading the
source. I think this is a universal problem with implementation
inheritance though, and I don't think I can do anything to really make
it better. </li>
  <li> Cel has some global state (not global variables). An example is
Cel tracks all cel faces and does not enable strong encapsulation.
There is no reason it has to be this way and it will be fixed. This
also applies to the list of predefined linker functions. It's not a
huge problem, mainly it makes sandboxing too hard. </li>
  <li> Cel is missing some type of controls, some of this will probably
never be added because they are too trivial (a progress bar) or are a
barrier to embedding (image support). </li>
  <li> Speed, overall profiling and optimization. </li>
</ul>
