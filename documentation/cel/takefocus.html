            <h2>notes</h2>
    <p><p>takefocus has no effect if the cel already has focus and none of its links has focus of the inputsource.</p><p>The onfocus(inputsource, false) event is sent to all cels that lose focus followed by onfocus(inputsource, true)
      for each cel that gain focus.  This means that there is opportunity for another cel to take focus before
      takefoucs returns.</p><p>The focus of the mouse is controlled by moving the mouse pointer, takefocus will have no effect on the mouse 
      focus.</p></p>
