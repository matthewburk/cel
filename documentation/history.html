  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Cel has been a work in progress for a long time.  The project was started sometime
  in 2003, I didn't keep records, but i have a demo from that far back.  It was originally
  a C library, and was started with the same basic concepts that are in Cel today.  It was a
  slow process, but finally in 2008 I was 'done' and ready to release it to the world.  This
  led me to create another demo, showing just how awesome it was.  This was not going to be 
  a hello world or a list of widgets, it was going to do something (I can't remember what).
  The demo worked, but I viewed it as a spectacular failure becuase it was just too 
  verbose, and managing memory was too hard(it was at least half of the code).  I had failed
  to create what I wanted, it was not easy enough to use.  So I thought fixing memory 
  management would solve my problem.  I had a vague idea about Lua from my days of playing 
  World of Warcraft, so I set about to do the same thing WoW did and create a Lua binding.

  <p>The Lua binding began in late 2008.  It didn't take long either, a few months of working
  on it only a couple of hours every night.  The Lua binding worked, but my exposure to Lua
  changed me.  Lua was beautiful, powerful, expressive and my C based gui was made for C, it
  was designed around the limitations of C, limitations that Lua did not have.  So I decided
  that Cel would be a Lua library with C as an afterthought, which meant starting over.  Cel
  the Lua library began in Jan-2009, although most of the fundamental concepts were in the
  original C library.</p>
